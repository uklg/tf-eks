deletiing


when deleting the infra do not delete the pvs if they are to be used by otehr pods


kubectl delete pvc pvc-csi


the module will delete the pvc and this

$ kubectl delete pod app-gp3
$ kubectl delete pvc pvc-csi

$ kubectl get pv

will be blank



when deleting the infra do not delete the pvs if they are to be used by otehr pods



one way to do this to remove the state for this pvc if the environment type is prod and thus it will be set free and will not be deleted

if the env type is test then do not remove the state and then the pvc and thus pv is tidied up after deletion



add env variable to the output

if variable is prod then do something like remove the state for the created pv in create script



Today we are happy to share the general availability of the Amazon EBS CSI EKS add-on. This release contains added functionality, such as volume resizing and snapshotting for Linux, Windows support including snapshotting but without resizing


todo: add snapshotting


add output part to the wiki terraform and the script capture of output


Your PersistenVolumes will not be terminated while there is a pod, deployment or to be more specific - a PersistentVolumeClaim using it.



change reclaim policy form delete


ubectl get sc

rm@mini:~/i4/terraform$



then it will be kept

Delete/
Retain





The PV is not available for another claim after the PV has been released of its previous claim because the previous claimant's data is still on the volume. Recover the data and then re-create the PV using the same storage to make a new claim on that storage.

create a new pvc with same name and it will be attached to the correct pod


Delete the PV.

kubectl delete pv pv_name

The associated block volume or file system still exists after the PV is deleted.

Manually recover and clean up the data on the block volume or file system.

(Optional) Manually delete the block volume or file system.

To reuse the same block volume or file system, create a new PV with the same storage asset definition.
